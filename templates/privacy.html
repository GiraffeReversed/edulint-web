            <h5 class="card-title">Privacy policy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">No one likes to read a privacy policy with the length of a novella, so we will keep it
                brief and to the point.</p>

            <p class="card-text">We process and store some of your data, namely:

            <ul>
                <li>the submitted codes (their analysis is the core functionality; we also store them for academic
                    research and evaluation of new checks) </li>
                <li>IP address (used to detect the number of visitors; estimate country; prevent attacks and abuse; not
                    stored)
                </li>
                <li>user agent (used to detect the number of visitors and types of devices; stored for a maximum of 180
                    days)
                </li>
                <li>from which website you came to EduLint</li>
                <li>the sequence of actions you performed during your session</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">We will not provide your codes to third parties. We use them internally for evaluation
                of new checks. We may also create aggregate statistics (for example, most common errors) that will
                (hopefully) be published as part of an academic research paper.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The service is hosted in the EU and is provided by Anna Řechtáčková and her colleagues.
                Note that Cloudflare, Inc. is used as a proxy and may have access to the decrypted content while your
                data is in transit to us.</p>

            <p class="card-text">We do not use cookies and only save data to localStorage if necessary for the website’s
                functionality.</p>

            <p class="card-text">By submitting your code for evaluation, you acknowledge that you grant consent to the
                processing and storage of your data as outlined above.</p>

            <p class="card-text">You have the right to withdraw the consent, request retrieval, correction, or removal
                of your data. Note that we do not store the information about who submitted which code; you will
                therefore need to provide the list of SHA-256 hashes. To exercise these rights or to send inquires,
                contact us at anna.rechtackova@mail.muni.cz.</p>
